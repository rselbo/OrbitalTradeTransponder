    Tired of waiting for a damn orbital trader to show up?

    We have the solution for you. A new-fandangled artifact that calls an orbital trader to your location. 
    
    The cheapest and easiest to make orbital beacons must be researched and created at a machining table. It works by attracting the closest tradeship in orbit so you can't control what ship comes to visit.
    
    Once you are sufficiently advanced you can research and call specific types of orbital tradeships. It must be created at the Advanced Fabrication table and it requires costly ingredients.

    Happy trading ya raider loving hecks!!!
